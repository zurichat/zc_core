Zuri Chat Core Api



## Description

The zc_core is an open source API that serves as the backend and backbone of Zuri chat.

Zuri Chat is an open source slack clone developed during the HNG8 internship program 





Zuri Chat implements a plug-in system that allows for much more functionality because different plugins can be developed by different creators. These plugins can then rest on the Zuri Chat Core backbone (zc_core) which is written in Golang.



## Language

Zc_core was written in Go because it is a fast, compiled language and it is easily scaled. Concurrency in Go is also ideal for implementing a plugin structure. This makes it easy to build on the project and allows for future expansion.



## API's

A list of the endpoints and the functions they implement can be found in the API folder that contains YAML files for each of the functionalities
